# Project 1
  - For this project, the data was taken from Arbnb Boston, which includes three seperate tables: listing.csv, calendar.csv, reviews.csv.
  - Calendar table provides all listing rooms for Boston as of 09/2016, listing table provides current avaiable listed rooms, and review offers all the reviews up to 09/2016 starting from 2013.

## Questions asked
  - Use calendar table to show all avaiable (unbooked) rooms/listings as of 09/2016 for Boston by year and month (i.e., the supply of the market).
  - Use review table to count the reviewers from 2013 to 2016 by year and month (i.e., the demand, the peak months)
  - For the current avaible listings, what are the top 10 Boston neighborhood that provide the most non-shared apartments, condos, and townhouses? (i.e., high-end supply)
